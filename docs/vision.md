# Allie Vision

Allie is an autonomous accessibility compliance workbench: a Rust-first evidence
harness that discovers an application's product surface, generates replayable
accessibility coverage, enriches judgment-heavy checks with agentic review, and
turns the result into enforceable release evidence.

## Audience

- Accessibility compliance engineers who want to point Allie at an application
  and get as much autonomous assessment, remediation planning, enforcement, and
  reporting as possible.
- Frontend engineers who need generated Playwright, axe, and regression coverage
  tied to source-adjacent remediation guidance.
- QA engineers who need browser-flow evidence for keyboard, focus, zoom/reflow,
  reduced-motion, modal, menu, and form-error behavior.
- Product, engineering, compliance, and audit stakeholders who need defensible
  release packets without a false legal guarantee.

## Job

Given a repo, staged app, credential profile, and policy pack, Allie should
discover the sitemap, product surfaces, and likely user stories; generate and
replay accessibility tests; map evidence to every relevant WCAG obligation; take
agentic vision passes on criteria that require judgment; and produce a report
where a compliance engineer can drill from standard to finding, test, artifact,
context, waiver, remediation, and release decision.

## Category

Allie is not a scanner, score, generic agent platform, or legal compliance
promise. It is an evidence system whose primary interface is a set of versioned
packets tied to discovered surfaces, generated flows, policy profiles, code
revisions, artifact sets, review attempts, remediation actions, and replay
commands.

## Strategic Bets

1. Autonomy should be packeted and replay-gated: discovery packet -> sitemap and
   story packet -> flow-plan packet -> generated E2E candidate -> evidence packet
   -> release decision.
2. A complete WCAG obligation ledger is the reporting spine. Each criterion
   needs status, scope, method, artifacts, confidence, residual review, and
   remediation context instead of a global score.
3. Deterministic and scripted failures can block releases. Model-only findings
   enrich review and should not block until promoted by scripted reproduction or
   human attestation.
4. Rust should own orchestration, schemas, policy, budgets, hashing, storage,
   promotion state, and release enforcement.
5. Browser automation belongs behind a narrow Playwright/axe worker boundary;
   model and vision calls belong behind a typed gateway with redaction receipts,
   provider allowlists, ZDR/no-fallback policy, prompt versions, and audit events.
6. Privacy, provenance, and replayability are product features, not later
   hardening.

## Six To Twelve Month Target

Allie can run in CI or locally against a staged application, autonomously
discover a representative product surface, generate and replay Playwright plus
axe coverage, preserve DOM, accessibility tree, screenshot, video/GIF, trace,
console, network, and model-review artifacts under redaction policy, and emit a
WCAG drilldown report that shows every criterion as pass, fail, not applicable,
not tested, or needs review. It can draft remediation plans and branch-scoped
patch attempts only when tied to evidence references and replay commands. It
explains release blocking decisions without claiming legal compliance.

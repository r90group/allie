# Competitive Landscape

Last reviewed: 2026-08-22

## Positioning Thesis

Allie should not compete as another accessibility scanner. The durable
differentiator is an evidence-packet workbench: autonomous surface discovery,
generated replayable tests, WCAG criterion-by-surface visibility, artifact
drilldown, agentic context that remains non-blocking until promoted, and release
decisions that can be audited.

Competitors prove the market wants automation, guided manual review, dashboards,
AI assistance, and enterprise audit workflows. Allie should use those lessons
while staying sharper about local reproducibility, privacy policy, provenance,
and host-agnostic CI/release contracts.

The overlay trust gap is now part of the category context. In April 2025, the
FTC approved a final order requiring accessiBe to pay $1 million and barring
unsupported claims that automated products can make or keep websites
WCAG-compliant. Allie should not answer that market scar with stronger AI
claims. It should answer with owned evidence packets, criterion ledgers,
replay-to-revision provenance, and explicit residual review needs.

Each entry records the same fields so roadmap discussions can compare Allie
against scanner, dashboard, manual-audit, browser-cloud, design, and AI-assisted
alternatives without collapsing them into one vague category.

The record shape is machine-checked by `npm run landscape:smoke`. Keep the field
labels stable unless the script changes with the document contract. The script
checks structure, source presence, and freshness; it does not replace human or
agent review of vendor claims.

## Landscape Records

### Deque axe-core

- **Category:** Open-source accessibility rules engine.
- **Automation depth:** Automated Web UI checks that can be embedded in browser,
  unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- **Standards claims:** Deque describes axe-core coverage for WCAG 2.0, 2.1,
  and 2.2 at A, AA, and AAA, plus standards that rely on WCAG.
- **CI/PR integration:** Deque describes axe-core as built to integrate with
  existing test environments so teams can automate accessibility testing beside
  regular functional testing.
- **Evidence artifacts and replay:** Produces rule results and WCAG-tagged
  violations, but replay and artifact graph semantics belong to the calling
  harness.
- **Manual review workflow:** None by itself; it is a machine-check engine.
- **AI/agentic claims:** None in the open-source engine.
- **Privacy/governance posture:** Local library execution can stay inside the
  consumer test environment.
- **Allie differentiation:** Treat axe-core as deterministic evidence inside a
  richer packet, not as the whole product surface, story map, or release policy.
- **Sources:** [axe-core GitHub](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core),
  [Deque axe-core](https://www.deque.com/axe/axe-core/)

### accessiBe and accessibility overlays

- **Category:** Accessibility overlay/widget vendor.
- **Automation depth:** Automated website modifications and AI-assisted
  accessibility claims around a plug-in overlay.
- **Standards claims:** The FTC alleged accessiBe claimed its plug-in could make
  any website WCAG-compliant; the final order bars unsupported automated
  WCAG-compliance and continuing-compliance representations.
- **CI/PR integration:** Overlay installed into the site experience rather than
  a repo-owned CI evidence loop.
- **Evidence artifacts and replay:** Public trust issue is the opposite of
  Allie's wedge: the FTC action centered on unsupported automated compliance
  claims, not replayable per-revision evidence packets.
- **Manual review workflow:** Not the primary trust contract in the FTC case.
- **AI/agentic claims:** AI-powered accessibility tool claims were central to
  the FTC's January 2025 complaint and April 2025 final order.
- **Privacy/governance posture:** Third-party overlay posture; Allie should keep
  local-first artifacts and provider routing explicit.
- **Allie differentiation:** Lead with evidence, status, confidence, residual
  review needs, and replay commands. Never promise legal compliance or automated
  remediation.

## Differentiation Bets

1. **Evidence packet as the product interface.** Every scanner, agent, browser
   run, manual review, waiver, and release projection should project into the
   same versioned packet graph.
2. **Replay before enforcement.** Generated or agentic findings remain advisory
   until replayed through deterministic/scripted evidence or promoted by human
   attestation.
3. **Criterion-by-surface visibility.** The report starts from WCAG criteria and
   product surfaces, not from whatever a scanner happened to find.
4. **Local-first and host-agnostic.** GitHub, Azure, browser clouds, and hosted
   dashboards are adapters over local artifacts, not the only way to use Allie.
5. **Governed AI.** Vision and LLM output should have model metadata, prompt and
   response artifacts, redaction receipts, confidence, and promotion state.
6. **No false legal guarantee.** Allie reports evidence, gaps, status,
   confidence, and residual human review needs.

## Landscape Review Checklist

Run this checklist before V1 positioning changes, hosted/dashboard work, pricing
or packaging decisions, and after any real-app dogfood run:

- Refresh `Last reviewed` with the review date.
- Add or remove vendors only with a source URL and an Allie differentiation
  note.
- For every entry, re-check automation depth, standards claims, CI/PR
  integration, artifacts/replay, manual workflow, AI claims, and governance
  posture.
- Mark claims as public-source observations, not legal or procurement advice.
- Run `npm run landscape:smoke` and keep the output with the PR evidence.

## Roadmap Prioritization Rules

- Prefer work that strengthens Allie's packet/replay/release-governance position
  over scanner-rule parity.
- Treat browser clouds, visual AI, and enterprise dashboards as adapters or
  projections until the local evidence contract is strong.
- Add AI/agentic capability only when it carries redaction, model metadata,
  confidence, promotion state, and human-review semantics.
- Do not build hosted dashboards before the host-agnostic CLI and artifact
  contract are easy to dogfood locally.
- If a competitor already solves a proposed workflow well, backlog the Allie
  version only when it materially improves provenance, replay, privacy, or
  standards drilldown.

## Watchlist

- Deque AI-assisted guided/manual testing depth and any public packet/export
  model changes.
- Evinced AI detection and clustering claims, especially whether findings become
  CI blockers and how evidence is retained.
- Level Access, TPGi ARC, Siteimprove, and Stark compliance-center evidence
  models.
- BrowserStack, Sauce Labs, and Applitools accessibility artifacts, screen-reader
  workflows, cloud export formats, and AI positioning.
- WAVE, IBM Equal Access, Accessibility Insights, Pa11y, and W3C ACT rules as
  open or neutral sources for evidence and coverage discipline.

## Review Cadence

Refresh this file before major V1 positioning changes, before hosted/dashboard
work, after dogfood in a real app, and at least monthly while Allie is actively
being shaped.
